-------------------------
This project, along with the software contained herein, is a "derived work" based on materials copyrighted by
and/or developed by Dexter Industries and/or their successor in interest, Modular Robotics.

As a consequence, it is released under the same license as was published
within the Dexter Industries/GoPiGo3 repository as viewed and copied on 2022/02/14:&nbsp;
(https://github.com/DexterInd/GoPiGo3/blob/master/LICENSE.md)<br>

It was copied *verbatim*, (cut-and-paste), as it existed at that time, and is included in its entirety beginning with the paragraph titled "Software License" as shown below.

My ownly question/reservation is the "Copyright" statement shown below,
as I doubt the MIT license is copyright Dexter Industries :wink:

Additional Notes for any prospective user
-----------------------------------------
The code contained herein is ***entirely experimental***, is being developed ***for my own use*** so that I can expand my programming skills
and ***may not be "ready for prime-time" or any other public use***.

Like the sign I saw on YouTube:&nbsp; If you use this software, something happens, and you try to sue me,
this document will be "Exhibit 'A'".
