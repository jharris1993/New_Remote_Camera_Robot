It was copied *verbatim*, (as in "cut-and-paste"), as it existed at that time, and is included in its entirety beginning with the paragraph titled [Software License](#software-license) as shown below.

My ownly question/reservation is the "Copyright" statement shown below within the MIT license as I doubt the MIT license is copyrighted by Dexter Industries :wink:<br>
