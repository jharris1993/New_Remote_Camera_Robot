It was copied *verbatim*, (cut-and-paste), as it existed at that time, and is included in its entirety beginning with the paragraph titled "Software License" as shown below.

My ownly question/reservation is the "Copyright" statement shown below,
as I doubt the MIT license is copyright Dexter Industries :wink:
