# New Remote Camera Robot
### Note that this is *experimental code*, it is *NOT* for general use, and *will change without notice!*
You can use this code if you want, but it is ***NOT*** guaranteed to work and will be changing almost continuously as I work on it.&nbsp; Do not submit issues as they will be ignored and closed.

## Project Overview:

This project is a modification of the original [Remote Camera Robot](https://https://github.com/DexterInd/GoPiGo3/tree/master/Projects/RemoteCameraRobot) project as developed by Dexter Industries for my GoPiGo-3 robot.

This currently works with a Saitek X52 joystick.  I hope to add support for
additional joysticks and/or a joystick configuration file.

## Objectives:

1. Develp and use Server Sent Event messages to send data back to the client for display
