# Dexter Industries GoPiGo3 Remote Camera robot
# With this project you can control your Raspberry Pi Robot, the GoPiGo3, with a phone, tablet, or browser.
# Remotely view your robot as first person in your browser.
#
# You MUST run this with python3
# To Run:  python3 flask_server.py
#
#  Modified by Jim Harris to eliminate nipple.js and allow robot control with a standard joystick.
#  Please direct support requests to user "jimrh" at https://forum.dexterindustries.com
