Version 1.1
   Simplify by eliminating mathematical calculations.
   Added revision markings.

The associated file is an example/test file whose entire function is to determine
how to capture and use the various readings and attributes of the connected
joystick.

axis 0 is the left-right axis such that:
*  Axis 0 represents the angular deviation of the robot
   to the right or left.
*  x(0) < 0 is a right turn
*  x(0) > 0 is a left turn.
*  x(0) = 0 represents no angular deviation at all.

axis 1 is the forward-backward axis such that:
*  Axis 1 represents the velocity of the robot. (speed of motion)
*  x(1) < 0 is forward motion
*  x(1) > 0 is backward motion
*  x(1) = 0 represents no forward or backward velocity at all.

The special case where both x(0) and x(1) = 0 is the stopped state
where there is no motion in any direction.  This is further
guaranteed by setting all angles and velocities to zero.

Revision:
Trigonometric calculation of velocity vectors eliminated in favor of a more direct approach.
Simplification by entirely eliminating the need for any mathematical calculatiuon for
velocity vectors and basing velocity entirely on the position of the "X" axis.

    Problem:
      There are two special cases where the robot can suddenly go from full speed
      forward to full supped reverse, or vice-versa - that is if the joystick is fully
      deflected to the right or left, and crosses the "X" axis in either direction.
      Viz.:  If the joystick is fully deflected right and is just above the "X" axis,
      The robot will be turning forward-right quickly.  If then the joystick is
      moved below the "X" axis, it will end up being commanded to go from full
      forward to full reverse within an extremely short period of time.
      This could end up damaging the motor controller due to excessive current
      through the "H" bridge upper and lower legs, or damage to the motor/geartrain
      by the sudden reversal of torque.

   Solution:
      The solution is actually very simple and eliminates the need for any mathematics
      whatsoever.

       The solution is simply to ignore the "Y" axis deflection when calculating the velocity
       of the robot, basing the velocity entirely on the magnitude of the "X" axis
       deflection.

       What this does is make the velocity of the robot wholly dependent on the "X" axis
       deflection.  In other words, if the joystick is deflected full forward, (i.e. moving
       forward at maximum velocity), as the joystick begins to describe a circle to the right
       or left, as the joystick moves around the circle and gets closer to the "X" axis in either
       direction, the turn will become tighter, but the velocity of the robot will become less
       and less as the joystick rotates closer and closer to the "X" axis.

       The result of this is that as the turn becomes sharper, the robot moves more and more slowly
       until it comes to a complete stop at full right or left deflection.  As the joystick continues
       moving around its circumfrence, the robot's direction will change but the velocity will
       increase slowly from the standing stop.

   Possible issue:
      There is a potential edge-case, (maybe not even an "edge" case), where the joystick is moved
      violently from one extreme to the other, resulting in a sudden change of velociy and directiono
      of travel.

      As a consequence, there may need to be a short pause introduced whenever the joystick crosses
      the "X"  or "y" axes. (I suspect that a 0.5 second pause would be sufficient.)
